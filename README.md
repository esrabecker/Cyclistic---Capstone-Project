# Cyclistic---Capstone-Project

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior
data analyst. I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to
answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze,
share, and act.

Scenario
As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Who is Cyclistic ?
A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.
